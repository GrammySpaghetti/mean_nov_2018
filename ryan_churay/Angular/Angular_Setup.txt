SETTING UP A NEW ANGULAR PROJECT INSIDE OF AND EXPRESS PROJECT

To run the project in the terminal make sure mongod is running, ng build --watch, and the nodemon server.js is running

npm install -g @angular/cli (installs angular globally on your machine)

Navigate to your express project 
ng new public (creates a new angular app)

Navigate to your angular project root
ng build --watch

In the express server.js file make sure the static is pointed to the angular app
app.use(express.static( __dirname + '/public/dist/public' ));

Navigate to the angular app and set up service in the terminal with:
ng g s http

Register the service by making the connections among the app components
.../app.app.module.ts
import { HttpService } from './http.service';
in the @NgModule add HttpService to the providers array

HttpClient connections
.../app/app.module.ts
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';
in the @NgModule add HttpClientModule to the imports array

Dependency Injection
.../app/http.service.ts
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
export class HttpService{
    constructor(private _http: HttpClient){}
}

.../app/app.component.ts
import { HttpService } from './http.service';
export class AppComponent{
    title = 'app'
    constructor(private _httpService: HttpService){}
}
